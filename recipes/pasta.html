    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Uni (pronounced [oo-nee]) means sea urchin in Japanese. Uni Pasta (うにパスタ) is a creamy Japanese-style pasta starring sea urchin. In this recipe, we have al-dente spaghetti coated with a luscious orange sauce made with fresh sea urchin, heavy cream, and white wine. The ingredients for the pasta are very simple, yet the sweet and salty uni flavor takes the center stage. The rest like sautéed garlic, shallot, and red pepper flakes work alongside to bring this gem together.</p>
