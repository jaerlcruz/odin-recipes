    <h2>Ingredients (for 9 cookies)</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2.5 oz slivered almonds</li>
        <li>3 tbsp sugar</li>
        <li>1 1/2 tbsp honey</li>
        <li>2 tbsp heavy cream</li>
        <li>2/3 cup cake flour</li>
        <li>3 tbsp almond flour</li>
        <li>1/4 cup confectioner's sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp vanilla paste</li>
        <li>1/4 cup unsalted butter (for dough)</li>
        <li>1 1/2 tbsp unsalted butter (for nougat)</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp salt (split into two 1/4 tsp, one for nougat, one for dough)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <h3>Let's start the cookies!</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine butter, salt, and confectioner's sugar in a bowl. Mix until combined. Add vanilla paste and mix.</li>
        <li>In the same bowl, add sifted cake flour and almond flour. Gently fold until it becomes a doughy texture.</li>
        <li>Scoop out 1 tbsp sized pieces of dough and roll into balls. Place onto baking sheet. <em>Remember: this recipe is for 9 cookies. Save the remaining dough for the hedgehog's nose and legs!</em></li>
        <li>Cover the baking sheet with saran wrap and refrigerate for 50-60 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>For the nougat:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Pour slivered almonds onto a baking sheet. Bake at 350 degrees F for 6-7 minutes. Let cool.</li>
        <li>Put butter, honey, and heavy cream into a sauce pan and put on medium heat. Then, add sugar and salt. Stir.</li>
        <li>Bring this mixture to a boil and add the cooled toasted almonds. Stir, while boiling until thickened.</li>
        <li>Spread the nougat onto a sheet and let it cool down.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Baking and assembling the cookies:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Bake the chilled dough at 320 degrees F for 20-25 minutes. If there are cracks when you take them out, slightly press while the cookies are still hot.</li>
        <li>Attach nose and leg details with the extra dough. Bake at 320 degrees F for 5-6 minutes.</li>
        <li>Divide almond nougat into 9 portions on a sheet, then slightly melt using residual heat from the oven.</li>
        <li>Wrap the lower portion of the cookies with the nougat to form the hedgehogs' spikes. Add extra quills with more almonds if you like.</li>
        <li>Use melted chocolate for facial details, then enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
