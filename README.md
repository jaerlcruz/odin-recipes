From The Odin Project.

Practicing HTML to form a basic recipe website: a page with a main index with links to some recipes.

Future objective: Style with CSS.

# Self Reflection
* Got to make my own decisions on what I wanted to display.
* Threw in extra formatting beyond the requirements for the project (and I have yet to add more).
